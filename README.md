# Telegraph-rs 
A reimplementation of telegra.ph (Telegram's writing service) in Rust with markdown support and first-class support for hosting as a Tor hidden service!
 
Unlike Telegram's version, Telegraph-rs is truly anonymous, no user data beyond the written words of the author and the title are collected.
 
## Features
- Lightweight: Runs with under 10 MB of memory
- Private: No tracking of users, runs great on Tor
- Stable: Data stored as flat files, no databases
- Public Domain: Its your code too, ya know!
- Easy audit: Read all of the code in under 30 mins.

## Why?
- Telegraph is cool, Telegram is a fed honeypot
- You deserve to share your thoughts with the world
- Why not? I hope people find it useful and enjoyable
