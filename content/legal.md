# Legal Information & Privacy Policy
## What This Service Does

This service allows you to publish text content formatted with markdown. We store only the text you write - we do not host any images, videos, or other files. When you include images or videos in your posts, you're linking to files hosted elsewhere on the internet. We simply format your text and make it readable on a webpage.

This service has no user accounts or registration system - anyone can publish anonymously. Your published content is completely public. Anyone who has the link to your post can read it. There are no privacy settings or private posts on this service.

## Privacy and Data Collection
**For People Who Publish Content:**
We store only the words you write. Specifically, we store the text content you choose to publish, the timestamp when you published it, and any alias name you optionally provide. We do not track your IP address, use cookies for tracking, collect analytics, or gather any other personal information about you. We do not store or have access to any images, videos, or other media files you might link to in your posts.

**For People Who Read Content:**
We collect nothing from readers. While the server receives your request to serve the page, no IP addresses, cookies, tracking, analytics, or identifying information is stored or logged. Your request only informs an in-memory cache that keeps frequently accessed pages saved in memory faster response times. The cache system never writes to disk and doesn't store any specifics.

## Important: Service Privacy Is Not Anonymity
This service protects your privacy from us, but cannot protect your anonymity from others. Your writing creates a unique "fingerprint" through topics, style, word choices, idioms, sentence patterns, cultural references, and experiences. Additionally, metadata from files or websites you link to may contain identifying information. The service is not a magic bullet for anonymity - you are responsible for your own operational security.

To stay anonymous, vary your writing style between posts, avoid usual phrases, change sentence structures, be mindful of cultural references and topic combinations, and check metadata of linked content. Anyone can use any alias since there are no accounts, meaning impersonation is possible. These practices are your responsibility, not ours.

## Free Speech and Content Policy
This service is committed to protecting freedom of speech and the right to advocate for your beliefs. We will not censor or remove content simply because we or others disagree with the ideas expressed. You have the right to share controversial opinions, advocate for political causes, discuss sensitive topics, and express unpopular viewpoints.

We will only remove content that is actually illegal under applicable law, constitutes spam or automated abuse, or clearly violates others' rights. Content that is merely offensive, controversial, or disagreeable will not be removed.

You are responsible for everything you publish. You must have the right to publish anything you submit. Remember that once you publish something, it's public and we cannot control who sees it or what they do with it.

## How We Handle Your Data
Your content is stored as simple text files on our server. We take reasonable steps to keep these files secure, but we cannot guarantee perfect security or that your content will be preserved forever. Your content will remain available indefinitely unless we need to remove it for legal reasons or service maintenance. You can always get your content back in its original markdown format by adding ".md" to the end of any post's URL.

Since we only host text and not media files, we're not responsible when images or videos you've linked to become unavailable, change, or contain problematic content. Those files are controlled by whoever hosts them, not by us.

## Service Limitations
We provide this service "as-is" without any guarantees. We don't promise that the service will always work, that your content will be preserved forever, or that we won't need to shut down or change the service. We are not responsible for any problems that arise from your use of this service.

## Legal Matters
You keep ownership of the content you create, but by publishing it here, you give us permission to store and display it. In response to valid legal processes, we can only provide the raw text content you've published - no IP addresses, user data, logs, or tracking information exists for us to share. We don't have access to any information you don't write and publish.

If we receive valid legal demands to remove content that violates applicable law, we may comply after careful review. However, we will resist removal requests based solely on content being objectionable or offensive. We will ignore demands that appear false, abusive, or attempt to censor legal speech.

We believe in protecting your right to express your views, even when those views are unpopular or controversial.

## International Users
This service operates under the laws of the jurisdiction where our servers are located. However, you are responsible for making sure that your use of this service and the content you post complies with the laws in your location. What's legal in one place might not be legal in another.

## Children
This service is not intended for children under 13 years old. We don't knowingly collect any information from children under 13.

Any content that sexualizes, exploits, or fetishizes children is strictly prohibited and will be removed immediately. This includes written content, links to such material, or any other form of child exploitation content. Such violations will result in reporting to relevant authorities as required by applicable law.

## Changes to This Policy
We may need to update this policy occasionally. If we make significant changes, we'll update the date at the top of this page. By continuing to use the service after changes are made, you're agreeing to the updated terms.

## Getting Help
This is an open-source project available on GitHub at https://github.com/du82/nonograph. If you have questions about the service, found a bug, or need technical help, please create an issue in that repository.
